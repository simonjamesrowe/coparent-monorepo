/sh# Product Mission - CoParent

## Pitch

CoParent is a unified digital platform that helps separated and divorced parents coordinate parenting responsibilities, manage shared expenses, and maintain clear communication—reducing conflict, building trust, and creating a legally sound record of their co-parenting relationship.

## Vision Statement

To empower separated parents to co-parent effectively by providing a calm, professional space where communication is structured, finances are transparent, and important family information is always accessible and organized.

## The Problem

### Problem 1: Fragmented Communication Creates Conflict and Legal Risk

Separated parents often rely on text messages, phone calls, and emails to coordinate parenting duties. This fragmented approach leads to:
- Miscommunication about custody schedules, resulting in missed pickups and scheduling conflicts
- Heated arguments that expose children to parental conflict
- Lost communication history, making it difficult to resolve disputes
- No formal record of agreements, creating legal vulnerability if custody arrangements are challenged
- Important decisions (medical, educational, financial) discussed across multiple platforms without clear documentation

**Our Solution:** A dedicated, professional communication channel with structured workflows (permissions, approvals, requests) that maintains a timestamped, immutable record of all discussions and decisions.

### Problem 2: Financial Opacity Prevents Trust and Fair Contribution

When parents share expenses for childcare, activities, medical care, or school, transparency breaks down:
- Receipts get lost or misremembered
- One parent feels they're paying more than their fair share
- Reimbursement disputes arise due to unclear amounts or purposes
- No clear visibility into what's been spent on the child
- Trust erodes as financial contributions become unclear or contentious

**Our Solution:** A comprehensive expense tracking system with receipt uploads, budget visibility, automatic reimbursement requests, and optional bank integration—ensuring financial transparency builds trust rather than destroying it.

### Problem 3: Missing Documentation Hurts Legal Standing

Parents often lack a central repository for critical information:
- Medical records scattered across doctor's offices and personal files
- School documents, emergency contacts, and authorization forms lost or forgotten
- No evidence trail if custody disputes arise
- Difficulty proving parental involvement or contribution history
- Child's progress, achievements, and milestones not documented or shared

**Our Solution:** A secure, organized information repository where medical records, school documents, emergency contacts, and important life events are stored, timestamped, and easily accessible to both parents.

## Differentiators

### 1. Purpose-Built for Co-Parenting, Not Generic Project Management

Unlike general collaboration tools (Slack, Asana) or family apps (Life360, Cozi), CoParent is specifically designed for separated parents. Every feature—from messaging workflows to expense approval systems—is built with co-parenting dynamics in mind, avoiding generic tools that don't address the unique needs of separated families.

**Result:** Users get a focused, intuitive experience without irrelevant features or design patterns that don't match their reality.

### 2. Legal-Grade Documentation and Evidence Trails

Unlike messaging apps or general family organizers, CoParent creates legally sound records. Every action is timestamped, every communication is logged, and the system is designed to produce documentation that holds up if needed in court or mediation.

**Result:** Parents have protection and peace of mind, knowing their decisions and agreements are documented professionally.

### 3. Expense Transparency Prevents Trust Breakdown

Unlike general budgeting apps, CoParent's expense tracking is designed specifically for shared parenting costs. It includes receipt uploads, approval workflows, and integration with bank feeds—ensuring both parents see exactly what's being spent on their children.

**Result:** Financial disputes are minimized because transparency replaces suspicion.

### 4. Calm, Professional Design Reduces Conflict

The "Calm Harbor" design system intentionally creates an environment of trust and professionalism. The interface is soothing, not chaotic; structured, not free-form. This design philosophy extends to every interaction, helping parents stay calm and respectful even during difficult conversations.

**Result:** The platform itself becomes a tool for de-escalation and healthier co-parenting relationships.

## Core Features

### Communication & Coordination

**Parent-to-Parent Messaging**
Professional, structured communication channel with threading and moderation capabilities. Separates casual conversation from formal requests and decisions. Creates a permanent, searchable record of all co-parenting communication.

**Shared Calendar Management**
Unified calendar showing custody schedules, activities, school events, appointments, and important dates. Prevents double-booking and scheduling conflicts. Notifications ensure both parents are informed of changes. Accommodates complex arrangements like shared weekdays or alternating weeks.

**Permission Request Workflow**
Formal system for requesting approval on decisions (field trips, activity enrollments, schedule exceptions, special purchases). Creates a documented approval trail rather than relying on informal agreement. Reduces conflict by making the request and approval process clear and predictable.

### Financial Management

**Expense Tracking & Approval**
Log shared expenses with category, amount, date, purpose, and receipt uploads. Request reimbursement from co-parent with formal approval workflow. Budget tracking shows spending patterns across categories. Optional receipt scanning for quick data entry.

**Bank Integration (Future)**
Optional connection to bank accounts or credit cards to auto-import transactions. Categorize spending and identify reimbursable expenses. Reduces manual entry and ensures nothing is missed.

### Documentation & Organization

**Information Repository**
Centralized storage for medical records, school documents, emergency contacts, vaccination records, and other critical information. All documents are timestamped and version-tracked. Both parents can upload and access, ensuring shared responsibility for record-keeping.

**Evidence Documentation System**
Timestamped, immutable record of important parenting moments—milestones achieved, behavioral patterns, health developments, achievements. Photos with context and dates. Serves as a documented record of parental involvement if needed for legal purposes. Protects both parents by creating objective records.

### Family Connection

**Photo Sharing**
Private family albums for sharing photos and moments. Categorized by child and date. Both parents can upload and view, keeping both informed and emotionally connected to the child's life and growth.

**Multi-Child Support**
Manage separate calendars, expenses, and information for each child. Handle different custody arrangements, school schedules, and individual needs. Each child gets their own timeline and documentation space.

### Onboarding & Access

**Parent Invitation System**
Streamlined process for adding the co-parent to the platform. Acceptance workflow ensures both parents have agreed to participate. No friction in getting started. Optional child information import to pre-populate family structure.
